        <p>Hi! My name is Yueyang Chen. I am a Computer Science student at Rose-Hulman Insitite of Technology.
            I really enjoy working of projects such as game design and creating applications that make small things
            in life easier. I also really enjoy working with Java and Python to create my projects. 
            I am current really interested in starting to learn about Cyber Security and Machine learning. Both of these topic look
            really interesting and something that I could put alot of time into to learn on my own.</p>
